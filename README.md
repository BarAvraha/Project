# Text and Tabular Data Analysis of American Political meetings along Time and Space
Government meetings play a pivotal role in deliberation, decision-making, and policy shaping, offering insights into the political landscape of a given region. In today's data-driven world, researchers and policymakers leverage these platforms to uncover hidden patterns, monitor evolving trends, and gain deeper insights into complex dynamics. The LOCALVIEW\cite{simko2023localview} dataset represents a vast compilation of government meeting records, incorporating video, text, and tabular data. It encompasses a range of years and geographical locations across the United States, providing a comprehensive snapshot of political activities. This expansive dataset captures not only political discourse but also provides a unique opportunity for in-depth exploration. Within this study, our exploration of the LOCALVIEW dataset focus in on text transcripts and tabular data from meetings. By employing a multi-pronged approach that amalgamates natural language processing, machine learning, and visualization techniques, our aim is to uncover latent topics, trace sentiment trends, and predict political dynamics.By utilizing the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model \cite{pritchard2000inference}, latent themes within the dataset are revealed. Subsequently, our in-depth emotion analysis employs techniques such as cluster analysis, dimensionality reduction, and graph analysis to paint a comprehensive picture of the emotional intricacies underpinning the meetings. Leveraging the advanced capabilities of the BERT model \cite{devlin2018bert}, we predict the state of origin with remarkable precision, accurately discerning the source state of each political meeting. Furthermore, our exploration into the relationship between racial demographics and recent election voting patterns delves deep into the importance of race demographic features as opposed to general time-varying demographic features. As we navigate through this study, we aspire to shed light on the evolving nature of political discourse, offering valuable insights and contributing to the broader understanding of American political dynamics.
